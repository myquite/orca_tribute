          <p>
            Orcas, or killer whales, are the largest of the dolphins and one of
            the world's most powerful predators. They're immediately
            recognizable by their distinctive black-and-white coloring. Smart
            and social, orcas make a wide variety of communicative sounds, and
            each pod has distinctive noises that its members will recognize even
            at a distance. They use echolocation to communicate and hunt, making
            sounds that travel underwater until they encounter objects, then
            bounce back, revealing their location, size, and shape.

          <h2>Hunting and Diet</h2>
          <p>
            Though they often frequent cold, coastal waters, orcas can be found
            from the polar regions to the Equator. They're at the top of the
            food chain and have very diverse diets, feasting on fish, penguins,
            and marine mammals such as seals, sea lions, and even whales,
            employing teeth that can be four inches long. They are known to grab
            seals right off the ice. They also eat fish, squid, and seabirds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orcas hunt in deadly pods, family groups of up to 40 individuals.
            There appear to be both resident and transient pod populations of
            orcas. These different groups may prey on different animals and use
            different techniques to catch them. Resident pods tend to prefer
            fish, while transient pods target marine mammals. All pods use
            effective, cooperative hunting techniques that some liken to the
            behavior of wolf packs.
          </p>
          <h2>Reproduction</h2>
          <p>
            Orcas are protective of their young, and other adolescent females
            often assist the mother in caring for them. Mothers give birth every
            three to ten years, after a 17-month pregnancy. They give birth to
            one baby at a time, which may nurse for up to two years. In most
            cases, the bond between juvenile and mother will eventually weaken,
            and the young orca will go its own way, but in some pods, the
            juvenile may stay with the pod it was born into its entire life.
